# Problem Solving Exercise

#### Assumptions or decisions:

1. Assumption #1:
  * The data will always be provided in a table.
  * decision: I will use a database with a table Products structured as follows:

| id    | product   | customer  | measure   | value       | valid_from_day | valid_to_day |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
|Serial |varchar    |varchar    |varchar    |decimal      |date            |date          |

2. Assumption #2:
  * I need to convert the products rows (database objects) into ruby objects to interact with them easily using an ORM (DataMapper).

3. Assumption #3:
  * My program should return a table of identical products that shares the same customers, measures and has overlapping date ranges.

4. Assumption #4:
  * I can use any language of frameworks to deliver a working solution:
  * decision: I elected to use rails as - through scaffolding - I can create a solution in a few minutes.

5. Assumption #5:
  * Due to the simplicity of the task I don't need to TDD it.

#### The process:

1- Createing a new rails 4 app:
  `rails _4.2.7_ new . ProductManager -d postgresql -T`
2- Creating a scaffold of the product with the attributes from the table:
  `rails g scaffold Product product:string customer:string measure:string value:decimal valid_from_day:date valid_to_day:date`
  (I though about changing the `product` attribute to `title` but then chose to stick to the specifications provided)
  Then migrated: `rake db:migrate`

  Now through my scaffold I have a form to add products with the attributes I need:

  ![It Works!!!](http://i64.tinypic.com/3090ocg.jpg "it Works!!!")

  And upon adding the first product it will be displayed in a table:

  ![It Works!!!](http://i64.tinypic.com/s5ztkh.jpg "it Works!!!")

  But I'll add my products by seeding the database.


3- Seeding the database with the examples provided:

```
# in /db/seed.rb

Product.delete_all
Product.create!(product: 'Widgets', customer: 'Tesco', measure: 'Gross Sales Price', value: 1.0, valid_from_day: "2013-01-01", valid_to_day: "2013-04-01")
Product.create!(product: 'Widgets', customer: 'Tesco', measure: 'Gross Sales Price', value: 1.5, valid_from_day: "2013-03-01", valid_to_day: "2013-12-31")
Product.create!(product: 'Widgets', customer: 'Tesco', measure: 'Gross Sales Price', value: 2.0, valid_from_day: "2013-04-01", valid_to_day: "2015-01-01")

....

```
Then: `rake db:seed`

And now this is how my index looks:

![It Works!!!](http://i65.tinypic.com/2jeo1so.jpg "it Works!!!")

(I noticed that product number 9 which had wierd dates (i.e 0000000 99999) was created but the valid from and to dates were added to the database as NULL)

4- Create a method to find maching products:
  * I added a method to the Product model to find a match:
  ```
  def a_match?(another_product)
    if self.id != another_product.id && self.product == another_product.product && self.customer == another_product.customer && self.measure == another_product.measure && (self.valid_from_day..self.valid_to_day).overlaps?(another_product.valid_from_day..another_product.valid_to_day)
      true
    else
      false
    end
  end
  ```
  * and used it in the index view to print tables of each matching pair:
  ```
  <h1>Matching Products</h1>

  <% @products.each do |product| %>
    <% matched_products = @products.select {|p| product.a_match?(p) }.each do |matched_product| %>
      <table class="table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Row ID</th>
            <th>Product</th>
            <th>Customer</th>
            <th>Measure</th>
            <th>Value</th>
            <th>Valid from day</th>
            <th>Valid to day</th>
            <th colspan="3"></th>
          </tr>
        </thead>

        <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td><%= product.id %></td>
                <td><%= product.product %></td>
                <td><%= product.customer %></td>
                <td><%= product.measure %></td>
                <td><%= product.value %></td>
                <td><%= product.valid_from_day %></td>
                <td><%= product.valid_to_day %></td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><%= matched_product.id %></td>
                <td><%= matched_product.product %></td>
                <td><%= matched_product.customer %></td>
                <td><%= matched_product.measure %></td>
                <td><%= matched_product.value %></td>
                <td><%= matched_product.valid_from_day %></td>
                <td><%= matched_product.valid_to_day %></td>
              </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

    <% end %>
  <% end %>
  ```


And this is how it looks now:

![Matching tables!!!](http://i64.tinypic.com/nf2z5t.jpg)


ِAnd through editing the date of a product the overlapping dates could be removed.

#### To do:
* Add button to remove overlapping dates with one click.
* Refactor views into partials

#### To run the app:

* Please clone the repo:
  `$ git clone git@github.com:cyberplanner/problem_solving_exercise.git`
* cd inside the app's directory:
  `$ cd problem_solving_exercise`
* Run bundle:
  `$ bundle install`
* Create the datebase:
  `$ rake db:create`
* Seed the database:
  `$ rake db:seed`
* Run the server:
  `$ rails s`

* Visit the app's root page:
  http://localhost:3000/
